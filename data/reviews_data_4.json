I hadn't had any in years, since Yankee stopped shipping to Canada.\n\nBut when I saw it on Amazon, I ordered one. It smells, as I said in the title, very much just as good as I remember it. Just delicious chocolate cake. You can smell both the cake and the rich icing And it just smells chocolatey and wonderful.\n\nIt's burning well too.\n\nI found that these desserty candles almost just as good as eating actual cake. I actually use them as a diet aid. I light one up each day, take a few deep breaths, mediate, read and relax for a few hours. It leads to less actual cravings for desserts as I feel like I'm already having the experience of it each day.\n\nChocolate just makes me happy. And this is a really nice chocolate\n\nAs for the Pumpkin Apple Parfait, I just tried it for the first time and loveit too.\n\nIt has a beautiful apple scent. I then do smell a vanilla/caramelly scent. And then there is some pumpkin in there too. Although the cent of this one faded quite a bit afew days in But overall, I'm happy with this one too. Both smell delicious"}, {"date": "2021-08-21", "title": "Very disappointed", "stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "review": "I was looking forward to this candle for 6 months ,got amazon card for my birthday and ordered it ..Yankee Candles were my favorite ,The smell of the chocolate cake was not the smell of chocolate cake ..I burned it for a while and still not smelling like chocolate cake ..I was thinking maybe sat on shelf for years ..Don't know .But will not be ordering any again."}, {"date": "2021-08-19", "title": "Yankee never disappoints", "stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "review": "This candle arrived very securely packaged all intact.
