Manufacturer replacing.", "stars": "2.0 out of 5 stars", "review": "UPDATED: Amazon advised I'd have to contact the manufacturer (Yankee Candle) directly as it was past the return date. They were very helpful.\nThey are sending me a replacement, however, there may be duties on it when it arrives due to it shipping from the US. Will update again when I receive the candle. If the duties are high, I'll have to contact them again for a better solution as I'm not paying more money for a new candle when it's supposed to be replaced at no cost to me. The candle smelling like gas was in no way my fault.\n---\nI was smelling the scent of gasoline in my office; I don't have any gas appliances and u checked my furnace. I've lite the candle only a few times and decided I should smell it because, who knows, maybe it's the candle. Shockingly it was! Pure gasoline.\n\nVery dissapointed as Yankee candles are not cheap and I now have a full French Vanilla Gasoline candle that I can't burn and paid almost $40 for."}, {"date": "2021-02-07", "title": "Disappointing lack of scent", "stars": "1.0 out of 5 stars", "review": "This has no vanilla scent.

I have tried other Yankee Candles and the smell always circulates nicely in the kitchen/living room due to the size and potency of these candles.

If I'm spending nearly $40 on a candle, I expect the scent to be very strong and spread throughout at least one room.

Especially because everyone commented on the scent of this candle and I am a vanilla die-hard. But there is no scent to this candle at all, and it isn't a faulty candle - this is just how Yankee Candles are, in my every experience. I left this candle on for *hours*, but I couldn't smell anything, so left the room and came back after about a half hour, and still no scent. Save your money, there are plenty better candles on Amazon, or take a quick trip to Bath and Body Works. Those candles fill up my room with delicious scents within minutes."}, {"date": "2019-05-12", "title": "Quick delivery and cheaper than at the store", "stars": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "review": "Quick delivery and cheaper than going to the store to purchase.
