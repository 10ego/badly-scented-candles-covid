2021-10-31,Not worth what I paid for,1.0 out of 5 stars,The wick was covered in wax. I had to get it out with a knife. I lit it up and it wouldn't stay lit because of the wax accumulating around the wick so there was basically never a flame but a little bit of blue light before it would extinguish. Never again.,False,0
2021-03-17,Smells like Gasoline. Manufacturer replacing.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATED: Amazon advised I'd have to contact the manufacturer (Yankee Candle) directly as it was past the return date. They were very helpful.
They are sending me a replacement, however, there may be duties on it when it arrives due to it shipping from the US. Will update again when I receive the candle. If the duties are high, I'll have to contact them again for a better solution as I'm not paying more money for a new candle when it's supposed to be replaced at no cost to me. The candle smelling like gas was in no way my fault.
---
I was smelling the scent of gasoline in my office; I don't have any gas appliances and u checked my furnace. I've lite the candle only a few times and decided I should smell it because, who knows, maybe it's the candle. Shockingly it was! Pure gasoline.

Very dissapointed as Yankee candles are not cheap and I now have a full French Vanilla Gasoline candle that I can't burn and paid almost $40 for.",True,1
2021-02-07,Disappointing lack of scent,1.0 out of 5 stars,"This has no vanilla scent. Previously I purchased the pine scent and it was fantastic. This vanilla one doesn‚Äôt have any smell and is very disappointing. For the price of a Yankee Candle, I expect high quality and a good scent.",True,1

You're only really going to smell it when you're very close. I live in a tiny apartment and it's still not filling the room I'm in let alone the rest of the apartment.

2020-05-11,No bang for your buck - smell is too faint,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I would not recommend this particular scent from this brand. I have tried other Yankee Candles and the smell always circulates nicely in the kitchen/living room due to the size and potency of these candles. French Vanilla, however, is such a faint scent and the room barely smelled like it. If I'm spending nearly $40 on a candle, I expect the scent to be very strong and spread throughout at least one room. I'm pretty disappointed with this purchase.",True,1

2020-01-14,Very weak fragance,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't get how Yankee Candle is a market leader. The scent is very weak, barely perceptible compared with other scented candles. On the plus side, the candle does burn for a long time. Still not worth $35.",True,1
2019-12-31,No scent?,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I always thought Yankee Candles were low quality based on my own previous experiences with them, but everyone loves them so much and this product got rave reviews (which I read to ensure they suited my needs), so I figured the formula must have changed over the years and I should give them another shot. Especially because everyone commented on the scent of this candle and I am a vanilla die-hard. But there is no scent to this candle at all, and it isn't a faulty candle - this is just how Yankee Candles are, in my every experience. I left this candle on for *hours*, but I couldn't smell anything, so left the room and came back after about a half hour, and still no scent. Save your money, there are plenty better candles on Amazon, or take a quick trip to Bath and Body Works. Those candles fill up my room with delicious scents within minutes.",True,1

2021-12-24,Like the scent but don't burn evenly,3.0 out of 5 stars,There definitely is a difference parrafin and soy wax. I am an avid candle user and will spend the money on a good candle but was disappointed with the burn. Maybe it needs 2 wicks. I have many Yankee candles and it seems like they have changed their wicks. If you don't trim them they are smokey. I do like their scents though so I end up scraping the sides of wax and put that it a warmer and also when it won't light anymore but there is still wax I put the whole jar in a warmer. For that price I don't want to waste any.,False,0

But when I saw it on Amazon, I ordered one. It smells, as I said in the title, very much just as good as I remember it. Just delicious chocolate cake. You can smell both the cake and the rich icing And it just smells chocolatey and wonderful.

It's burning well too.

I found that these desserty candles almost just as good as eating actual cake. I actually use them as a diet aid. I light one up each day, take a few deep breaths, mediate, read and relax for a few hours. It leads to less actual cravings for desserts as I feel like I'm already having the experience of it each day.

Chocolate just makes me happy. And this is a really nice chocolate

As for the Pumpkin Apple Parfait, I just tried it for the first time and loveit too.

It has a beautiful apple scent. I then do smell a vanilla/caramelly scent. And then there is some pumpkin in there too. Although the cent of this one faded quite a bit afew days in But overall, I'm happy with this one too. Both smell delicious",False,0
